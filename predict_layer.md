### Summary (Purpose)
This dataset was created for educational purposes to understand the application of logistic spatial regression models to publicly available citizen science data.
### Description (Abstract)
This raster layer is the output of a logistic regression model giving occupancy probability of American beaver (Castor canadensis) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The model was fit to 5 environmental variable predictor layers with a cell size of 25x25m: Marsh density within a 200 m radius, Anthropogenic density within a 200m radius, Open Water Wetland density within a 200m radius, Deciduous Forest/Shrub density within a 200 m radius, and mean distance from stream within a 200m radius. The marshes and open water wetland layers were extracted from the Alberta Merged Wetland Inventory. The deciduous tree cover was extracted from the ABMI Back-Filled Wall-to-Wall Vegetation Layer. Beaver occurrence data from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).  See credits for further detail on data sources.
